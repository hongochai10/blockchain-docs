# Tools Used to Analysis

## **Visualization**

1. Visual Paradigm: [https://www.visual-paradigm.com](https://www.visual-paradigm.com)
   * UML generation tools
2. Solplay: [https://github.com/ajsantander/solplay](https://github.com/ajsantander/solplay)
   * Realtime Solidity to various solc output visualizer, including post bytecode processing by other tools.&#x20;
   * Built by Zeppelin specifically for this audit, intended to accelerate the usage of other visualization tools.
3. Solmap: [https://solmap.zeppelin.solutions/](https://solmap.zeppelin.solutions/)
   * Realtime to bytecode output visualizer, with the ability to select opcode ranges and see the associated Solidity sources. Uses the compilerâ€™s sourcemap information.
   * Also built by Zeppelin for this audit.
4. Remix: [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
   * Solidity IDE.
   * Very robust for debugging Solc output.

## **Testing/Fuzzing**
